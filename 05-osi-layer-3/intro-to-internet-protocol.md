# Intro to Internet Protocol

Ethernet addressing is limited to networks sharing the same physical medium \(i.ethe broadcast domain\). In order to connect multiple distinct networks, a new technology is needed.

The Internet Protocol \(IP\) is the Layer 3 protocol that we use to address hosts and route traffic across networks.

There are two main types, IPv4 and IPv6.

IPv4 was adopted by IETF in 1981. IPv4 is the common version of IP we are used to dealing with.

Initially, every device was to have it's own IPv4 address.

The explosion of the Internet dramatically increased the number of connected devices so IPv4 was modified slightly to curb address exhaustion.

These modifications included NAT, PAT, and subnetting.

The supply of IPv4 has been exhausted \(most recently North America in Sept 2015\).
