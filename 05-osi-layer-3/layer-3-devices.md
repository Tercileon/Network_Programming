# Layer 3 Devices

The Network Layer consists of hardware primarily devoted to Routing packets.

**Routers** -  networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork until it reaches its destination node. Routers contain microprocessors that "make decisions" where to send packets based on the Ethernet \(MAC\) Address and how it's configured.

**Bridge-Routers \(Brouters\)** -  Network devices that work as a bridge and as a router. The Brouter routes packets for known protocols and simply forwards all other packets as a bridge would.

**Layer 3 Switches** - Designed for hardware based switching which is solely based on \(destination\) IP address stored in the header of IP datagrams.  Layer forwarding is performed by specialized ASICs – it is faster than routers, but they usually lack some of the advanced functionalities of routers.
