# IPv4 Addresses

IPv4 Addresses are represented in “dotted decimal” notation.

IPv4 addresses are 32 bits, so each decimal number is represented by a single byte.

You can represent an IP using an unsigned 32 bit data type..

There are 2^8 possible values for an octet ranging from 0-255.

In total, based on the quad-dotted notation there are approximately **4.3 billion** possible IPv4 combinations. However, almost 600 million IPv4 addresses have been reserved for special purposes, allowing approximately **3.7 billion** left for general usage.

In the Internet addressing architecture, the Internet Engineering Task Force \(IETF\) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority

\(IANA\) have reserved various Internet Protocol \(IP\) addresses for special purposes.
