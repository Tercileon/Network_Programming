![](/assets/osi.PNG)

The OSI model divides the complex task of computer-to-computer communications into a series of stages known as _layers_. Layers in the OSI model are ordered from â€‹the lowest level to highest. Together, these layers comprise the OSI stack. The stack contains seven layers in two groups:

**Upper layers:**

* Application
* Presentation
* Session

**Lower layers:**

* Transport
* Network
* Data link
* Physical
