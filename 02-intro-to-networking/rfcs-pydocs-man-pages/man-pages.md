# Man Pages

The BSD socket API is POSIX compliant and is the standard on Linux machines.

There are man pages that describe each system call.

The man pages can be accessed via a terminal in Linux, or via Google.

Man pages have different numbers for different sections. I typically link to man 7 pages which in turn link to the man 2 pages for specific calls.

* 7 describes the higher level operations
* 2 describes the system calls for C \(which are reused in Python\)

## e.g.

* man 7 socket describes sockets and the associated function calls.
* man 2 &lt;function name&gt; would provide details of a specific call for sockets
