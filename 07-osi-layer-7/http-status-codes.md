## HTTP Status Codes

The status code is a three-digit integer, and the first digit identifies the general category of response.

The first digit of the status code specifies one of five standard classes of responses. The message phrases shown are typical, but any human-readable alternative may be provided. Unless otherwise stated, the status code is part of the **HTTP/1.1** standard \([RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231)\).

So, if you canâ€™t find the file that client is asking, then you send appropriate status code.

If the client has no permission to see the file, then you send appropriate status code.

[These are the list of status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) we can use.

Below are some common ones:

**100 Series, Informational**

* 100 Continue.

**200 Series, Successful responses**

* 200 OK - Your response will be in the data.

**300 Series, Redirection**

* 301 Moved Permanently - new URI likely provided in data.
* 307 Temporary Redirect - Use this new URI now and same METHOD to repeat the transaction.
* 308 Permanent Redirect - Use this new URI permanently and same METHOD to repeat the transaction.

**400 Series, Client Error**

* 400 Bad Request - Your request was not understood.
* 403 Forbidden - No access rights to URI
* 404 Not Found - No such URI
* 418 I'm a teapot - Coffee is poison!

**500 Series, Server Error**

* 500 Internal Server Error - Something probably errored/crashed while processing your request.
* 503 Server Unavailable - No server can handle the request at this time. May include a "Retry-After" key-value pair.

**A complete list of status codes is in the HTTP specification \(section 9 for HTTP 1.0, and section 10 for HTTP 1.1\).**
