# Fully Qualified Domain Name

**FQDN -** the complete, or absolute, domain name of a host, which combines the network domain with the host's name.

* **mail3.example.com.**

A typical domain name used to access a website is NOT an FQDN, because that domain does not reference a non-specific host, but one of several that can serve webpages for that domain.

* **www.example.com** may ultimately be served by **webserver.example.com.** or **www2.example.com.**

A technically correct FQDN ends with a dot as a reference to the root domain.

* Sometimes software that calls for FQDN does not require the ending dot, but the trailing dot is required to conform to ICANN standards.
